Flask-Logging
-------------

Filter certain requests from the Flask log. Useful during development
when requests fill up with /static/ URLs. Not for use in production,
Flask-Logging monkey patches the ``werkzeug`` logging function.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    pip install flask-logging

Usage
^^^^^

::

    from flask.ext.logging import Filter
    filter = Filter('static')

Filters any request with the word 'static' from the log.

Filtering more than one word:

::

    filter = Filter('static', 'admin')

Updating the filter:

::

    filter = Filter('static')
    filter.filters = 'static', 'admin'
